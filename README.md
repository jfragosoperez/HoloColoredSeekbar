This project only contains resources for styling via drawables, the default Android Holo Seekbar. Another approach can be style the seekbar in styles and themes .xml files, but this project has only been created in order to not re-create each time the drawable resources.  NOTE: This module only contains the base holo colors described in the Android Design Guideline. Android Holo Colors has been the tool that has enabled to generate easily the colored drawables, so give it a try if you want to use other color that could fit better on your app style.
